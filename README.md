## Working

- An interactive app that lets users set reminders for themselves, that may or may not be scheduled.
- Within a reminder, there can be subtasks.
- The user can also specify whether or not the said reminder is important or not. If it is, it will have a higher priority over other reminders, and will be at the top of the list when displayed.
- The user can check off a sub-task, or the reminder as a whole to mark it as completed.
- The user can view reminders scheduled for a particular day.
- The user can see the calendar for any month for any year.
